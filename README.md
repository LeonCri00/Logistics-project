 A wireless access problem
This project formulates and solves a wireless access optimization problem using Integer Linear Programming (ILP). The problem is modeled to optimize wireless access points within a defined area, aiming to maximize coverage and minimize interference.

**Project Structure**
ILP Model Formulation: We propose an ILP model that defines the wireless access problem, focusing on optimal access point placement to ensure efficient network coverage.

AMPL Implementation: The model is implemented in AMPL, a high-level language for describing optimization problems.

Solution with CPLEX: Using the CPLEX solver, we solve the ILP model to obtain an optimized configuration of wireless access points based on the constraints and objectives defined.
